## empApp.v1

This is a non-MFP version of the ultimate mobile app.  It's fully supporting Ionic2, but it doesn't have the MobileFirst SDK in it.  It does not need to be registered to the MobileFirst console - just navigate to this folder and type ```ionic serve``` to see it running.

It uses the employees.json file in the /data folder as its datasource.
